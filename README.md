## DESCRIPTION
This project was a challenge for me. I was nervous and thought it would help me make better README files. While working on this project I learned a lot about working with the inquirer package. It was hard and tedious but the results speak for themselves. I think my version is simple. I chose to split the description section into multiple questions. I would probably do something a little different if I were to do it again.

## INSTALLATION
To install, I would copy all files. Then open in an editor like VS Code. Once that's done I would open terminal, run 'npm install', and then run 'node index.js'.

## USAGE
This program provides prompts and then takes all answers and turns them into a README markdown file.

## TESTS
I would test its input limits. I would also see how it responds to changes in input. There's a known issue where if the results directory isn't completely deleted between documents it will not write the new one to file.
